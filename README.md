# Capstone Project - Wine Quality

## 1. Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a model that estimates the subjective rating of a wine as graded by experts, using as inputs (features) the physicochemical properties of the wine.

There are two datasets, one for white wine (4,898 wines) and one for red (1,599 wines). They are all variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

This dataset could be used as a classification or a regression problem. I will be doing regression. Since wine properties are very different for white and red wines, I will be doing a separate analysis for each type of wine.

We found that it is possible to achieve reasonably accurate predictions of the rating by using a Random Forest approach. Using this data based approach can help wine producers supplement their traditional tasting methods.
